\chapter{The figures and tables in your document}

When writing information down, it can get boring to read.
Spice up that sh\dots text with some figures!

Insert a figure like the on Figure \ref{fig:Dummy1}.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Dummy}
\caption{A dummy figure}
\label{fig:Dummy1}
\end{figure}

Or, if you don't really know what to input, do as on Figure \ref{fig:Dummy2}.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[draft, width=0.75\textwidth]{Dummy}
\caption{A dummy figure, but without content}
\label{fig:Dummy2}
\end{figure}

Or perhaps you want two figure side by  side like figure \ref{fig:Dummy3} and \ref{fig:Dummy4}

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
	\centering

	\begin{minipage}[t]{.45\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Dummy}
		\captionof{figure}{The first figure.}
		\label{fig:Dummy3}
	\end{minipage} 
	\hfill % Fills the gap with empty space\usepackage{capt-of}
	\begin{minipage}[t]{.45\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Dummy}
		\captionof{figure}{Here it is again}
		\label{fig:Dummy4}
	\end{minipage}

\end{figure}

\section{Some tables}

It's table time.

\subsection{How to table}

Have a look at Table \ref{tab:boring}.
It's very boring.

\begin{table}[htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l X}
	\textbf{A number} & \textbf{A short text}  \\
	1 & This is the first number \\
	2 & This is also a number, but there's way more text in here. A lot more! It's crazy!!! It's two lines. \\
	3 & Now with a third line. \\
	5 & Oops -- we missed the forth number \\
	10 & It's all wrong now \\
	-4 & Wat?
	\end{tabularx}
	\caption{Boring table}
	\label{tab:boring}
\end{table}


\subsection{An excel arc}

Dear lord, you did not just!
Look what you did!
Look at Table \ref{tab:excel}! 
It's ugly as a new born baby's leftovers!

\begin{table}[htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{| l | X |}
	\hline
	\textbf{A number} & \textbf{A short text}  \\ \hline
	1 & This is the first number \\ \hline
	2 & This is also a number, but there's way more text in here. A lot more! It's crazy!!! It's two lines. \\ \hline
	3 & Now with a third line. \\ \hline
	5 & Oops -- we missed the forth number \\ \hline
	10 & It's all wrong now \\ \hline
	-4 & Wat? \\ \hline
	\end{tabularx}
	\caption{The Excel table}
	\label{tab:excel}
\end{table}


\subsection{An exotic table}

Lets add a header above and under the bold text\dots and at the end.
And lets add some colors.
Have a look at Table \ref{tab:exotic} -- it's much better!
Now you have a chance of seeing what is happening on each line with worrying about it looking ugly!

\begin{table}[htbp]
	\centering
	\rowcolors{1}{gray!20!white}{} % Color on every other line
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l X} \hline
	\hiderowcolors % We don't want the color on the title line
	\textbf{A number} & \textbf{A short text}  \\ \hline
	\showrowcolors % Show color for all rows to come
	1 & This is the first number \\
	2 & This is also a number, but there's way more text in here. A lot more! It's crazy!!! It's two lines. \\
	3 & Now with a third line. \\
	5 & Oops -- we missed the forth number \\
	10 & It's all wrong now \\
	-4 & Wat? \\ \hline
	\end{tabularx}
	\caption{A way funnier table}
	\label{tab:exotic}
\end{table}

\newpage
\subsection{Long-ass table -- aka. multi pages}

You need that?
YES -- ALWAYS in need of more!
Table \ref{tab:long} shows this.

\rowcolors{1}{gray!20!white}{} % Color on every other line
\begin{longtable}{p{0.15\textwidth} p{0.8\textwidth}} 
\hline
\hiderowcolors % We don't want the color on the title line
\textbf{A number} & \textbf{A short text}  \\ \hline
\showrowcolors % Show color for all rows to come
1 & This is the first number \\
2 & This is also a number, but there's way more text in here. A lot more! It's crazy!!! It's two lines. \\
3 & Now with a third line. \\
5 & Oops -- we missed the forth number \\
10 & It's all wrong now \\
-4 & Wat? \\ \hline
